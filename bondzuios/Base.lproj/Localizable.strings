Ideally all animals should live in their own habitats safely, however, it is impossible to release animals in captivity because they are not in conditions to survive in the wilderness while being free. \n\nOur contribution is that of providing people with information and igniting their love for nature. \n\nThere are many institutions that do their best to maintain adequate and proper conditions for animals in captivity and yet,  they need to establish ongoing communication with people to inform them about their activities in order to get their solidarity and financially support for the species' preservation. \n\nBondzù works every day so that people can enjoy live images of animals. The Bondzù Research and Development department is working on the design of various robotic devices and toys, seeking an environmental enrichment and a contribution in the increase of physical activity carried out by the captive animals. \n\nBondzù promotes love towards animals, but especially an attitude of respect for all living beings.";
